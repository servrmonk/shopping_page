Advance Redux


handling async tasks with redux

where to put our code

the redux devtool



Video Notes
Side Effects,async tasks and redux

Reducer must be pure, side effect free synchronous functions

input (Old state + Action) -> Output(New State)

where should side effect and async tasks be executed : ans is where to put side effect is inside the component ex useEffect,or inside action creators

async fun should not be inside the reducer function

we have 2 main option simply execute in component and inside the action creators



frontend code depends on backend code 

Backend API talking to frontend apk with http req

if we don't have backend api that does a lot of work -> send data and receive + use response



firebase : does not a lot of work (i.e just stores incoming data )we do have to do more work on frontend we have to transform data and send data (i.e. more code on the frontend , ahead of the reducer)

Fat Reducers vs Fat Components vs Fat Actions : Where should our logic (code) go?
than we have to differentiate bw synchronous ,side-effect free code (i.e data transformations) and Async code or code with side-effect

Prefer Reducer Avoid actions creators or components
